Why build yet another operating system?
---------------------------------------

* Because it's fun (most important point!)
* To learn and improve
* To study algorithms and system design
* It's meditative

General
-------
DON'T IMPLEMENT GRAPHICS. It's a crazy rabbit hole of VESA, VBE3, VGA,
SVGA, etc. especially when the BIOS isn't used. Plus, I've already
played around a lot with graphics -- better to focus on networking
which has far more well-documented hardware.

Try to make things as simple as possible when taking into account
current requirements -- not what might be needed in the future. Ie,
don't abstract out x86 until multi-platform is needed.

Build and run
-------------
* Build the cross-compiler docker image in build/compiler
* Use build/docker-bash to get a bash shell with the cross-compiler in /opt/cross/bin/
