Why build yet another operating system?
---------------------------------------

* Because it's fun (most important point!)
* To learn and improve
* To study algorithms and system design
* It's meditative

General
-------
DON'T IMPLEMENT GRAPHICS. It's a crazy rabbit hole of VESA, VBE3, VGA,
SVGA, etc. especially when the BIOS isn't used. Plus, I've already
played around a lot with graphics -- better to focus on networking
which has far better documentation.

Note: if I want to do graphics, I should probably use the multiboot
video feature. It's incredibly handy, if it works.

Try to make things as simple as possible when taking into account
current requirements -- not what might be needed in the future. Ie,
don't abstract out x86 until multi-platform is needed.

DON'T overthink naming. Ie, don't waste time thinking about "init" vs
"setup", verb-noun vs noun-verb, etc. It doesn't have to be
consistent.

Build and run
-------------
* Build the cross-compiler docker image in build/compiler
* Use build/build-shell to get a bash shell with the cross-compiler and run `make`
* Run with `run-qemu`

Notes
-----
* Kernel isn't started when constructors are run
* IRQs are mapped to start at 0x20 (IRQ_BASE_INTERRUPT)
