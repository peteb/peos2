support: rename "blocking_data_queue" to "blocking_ring_buffer"
support: improve ring_buffer performance using memcpy
support: improve memcpy performance
tcp: clean up the different *segment classes that are used by queues
tcp: retransmission
tcp: break up segments into sizes good for the current MTU
ipv4: fragment messages when sending too large
ramfs: implement read dir
support: rename pool::push_back to pool::push, emplace instead of emplace_back
tcp: remote and local window updates
tcp: selective ack
tcp: active open (client connect)
net: improve buffer handling to minimize number of copies
kernel: idle main should be run as supervisor so that it can hlt
kernel: writable mmap
kernel: use physical page allocator for page tables
kernel: keyboard interrupt should be offloaded, too much stuff going on
kernel: protection against page faults in the kernel stack during a syscall
kernel: remove inline intel syntax asm, it's confusing to have two styles
kernel: go through instability in test cases, fix them
kernel: initial page structures setup in boot.s are hardcoded to a small size, should be dynamic
kernel: `wait` should be able to fetch the exit status of the process
kernel: process priorities
testing: there can always be more integration tests
testing: benchmarking of various functions (for example, the net stack, process creation) so that improvements can be seen
support: optimize memcmp
vfs: user permissions
vfs/ramfs: extract filesystem datastructure
kernel: use global pages for kernel area so that they wont be flushed from TLB
kernel: CoW fork
misc: go through TODOs
kernel: handle errors/panics in IRQs (right now, the kernel will blame and kill the current process)
misc: change build system
misc: extract unittest framework code so that it can easily be reused in programs and libraries
misc: setup CI
net: extract code into a library
misc: make everything work on real hardware
misc: port a libc and stdc++lib
tcp: improve resource handling so that the code isn't hardcoded to a low number of connections etc
